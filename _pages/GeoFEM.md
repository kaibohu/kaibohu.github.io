The ERC Starting Grant ''GeoFEM (Geometric Finite Element Methods)'' investigates discretization of geometric objects with finite elements, connections between finite elements and discrete differential geometry, and applications.

GeoFEM will host lectures and short courses given by visitors and collaborators.
