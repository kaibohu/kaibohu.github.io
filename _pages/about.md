I am a <a href='https://royalsociety.org/grants/university-research/'>Royal Society University Research Fellow</a> based at the [School of Mathematics](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk), University of Edinburgh, and [Maxwell Institute](https://www.maxwell.ac.uk/).


I work on numerical partial differential equations and structure-preserving/compatible discretizations. In particular, most of my current work is on finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) with applications in continuum mechanics, topological hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics, geometric PDEs and numerical relativity. I view numerical analysis as a connection between continuous and discrete. Thus, I am interested in its interactions with neighbouring areas, such as discrete geometry and topology, geometric mechanics, and network theory. 


I obtained my PhD at <a href='https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn'>Peking University</a> in 2017. I had postdoctoral positions at the <a href='https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/'>University of Oslo</a> (2017-2018) and <a href='https://cse.umn.edu/math'>   University of Minnesota</a> (2018-2020) before moving to <a href='https://www.ox.ac.uk'>   University of Oxford</a>  (<a href='https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk'>Mathematical Institute</a> & <a href='https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk'>Christ Church</a>)  as a Hooke Research Fellow in 2021, and later as a Royal Society University Research Fellow. 

I am the PI of an ERC Starting Grant 'GeoFEM (Geometric Finite Element Methods)'. The project investigates discretization of geometric objects with finite elements, connections between finite elements and discrete differential geometry and applications.
