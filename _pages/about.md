I am a Senior Research Fellow and Associate Professor, and <a href='https://royalsociety.org/grants/university-research/'>Royal Society University Research Fellow</a> at the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford.

My research develops Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC) and its generalization Finite Element Tensor Calculus (FETC) as a unifying framework for structure-preserving numerical discretizations.

This aims to bridge continuous mathematical structures with compatible, geometry-aware numerical schemes, exploring connections to differential geometry, topology, homological algebra, representation theory, and mathematical physics. Applications include magnetohydrodynamics, continuum mechanics, numerical relativity, and geometric PDEs.
Current directions focus on general patterns of discrete tensor fields, computational topological (magnetohydro)dynamics, structure-preserving Einstein equations, generalized continua via Hilbert complexes, and finite element approaches to discrete differential geometry and mechanics.

I obtained my PhD at <a href='https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn'>Peking University</a> in 2017, followed by postdoctoral positions at the <a href='https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/'>University of Oslo</a> (2017–2018) and the <a href='https://cse.umn.edu/math'>University of Minnesota</a> (2018–2020). I joined the <a href='https://www.ox.ac.uk'>University of Oxford</a> (<a href='https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk'>Mathematical Institute</a> & <a href='https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk'>Christ Church</a>) as a Hooke Research Fellow in 2021, later becoming a Royal Society University Research Fellow. Previously, I was a Reader at the <a href='https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk'>School of Mathematics</a>, University of Edinburgh, and <a href='https://www.maxwell.ac.uk/'>Maxwell Institute</a>.

I am the PI of an ERC Starting Grant 'GeoFEM (Geometric Finite Element Methods)'. The project investigates discretization of geometric objects with finite elements, connections between finite elements and discrete differential geometry and applications.
