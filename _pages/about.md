I am a Royal Society University Research Fellow based at <a href='https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk'>Mathematical Institute</a> & <a href='https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk'>Christ Church</a>, University of Oxford.  

I work on numerical partial differential equations and structure-preserving/compatible discretizations. In particular, most of my current work is on finite element exterior calculus (FEEC). I view numerical analysis as a connection between continuous and discrete. Thus I am interested in its interactions with neighbouring areas, such as discrete geometry and topology, homological algebra, geometric mechanics; and applications in scientific problems, such as numerical relativity, continuum mechanics, and geometric PDEs.  

I obtained my PhD at <a href='https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn'>Peking University</a> in 2017. I had postdoctoral positions at the <a href='https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/'>University of Oslo</a> (2017-2018) and <a href='https://cse.umn.edu/math'>   University of Minnesota</a> (2018-2020) before moving to <a href='https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk'>Oxford University</a> as a Hooke Research Fellow in 2020.

I will move to the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk) from 1 October, 2023.
