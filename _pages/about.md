I am a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_University_Research_Fellowship'>Royal Society University Research Fellow</a> based at the [School of Mathematics](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk), University of Edinburgh, and [Maxwell Institute](https://www.maxwell.ac.uk/).


I work on numerical partial differential equations and structure-preserving/compatible discretizations. In particular, most of my current work is on finite element exterior calculus (FEEC). I view numerical analysis as a connection between continuous and discrete. Thus, I am interested in its interactions with neighbouring areas, such as discrete geometry and topology, homological algebra, and geometric mechanics, and applications in scientific problems, such as continuum mechanics, numerical relativity and geometric PDEs.  

I obtained my PhD at <a href='https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn'>Peking University</a> in 2017. I had postdoctoral positions at the <a href='https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/'>University of Oslo</a> (2017-2018) and <a href='https://cse.umn.edu/math'>   University of Minnesota</a> (2018-2020) before moving to <a href='https://www.ox.ac.uk'>   University of Oxford</a>  (<a href='https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk'>Mathematical Institute</a> & <a href='https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk'>Christ Church</a>)  as a Hooke Research Fellow in 2021, and later as a Royal Society University Research Fellow. 


 With <a href='http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~jb2055/index.htm'>Julian Braun</a> (Heriot-Watt), I am co-organizing the <a href='https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics/events/acm'>Applied and Computational Mathematics (ACM) Seminars</a> joint between UoE and HW at the <a href='https://www.maxwell.ac.uk'>Maxwell Institute</a>.
