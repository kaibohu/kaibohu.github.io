I am a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_University_Research_Fellowship'>Royal Society University Research Fellow</a> based at the [School of Mathematics](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk), University of Edinburgh, and [Maxwell Institute](https://www.maxwell.ac.uk/).


I work on numerical partial differential equations and structure-preserving/compatible discretizations. In particular, most of my current work is on finite element exterior calculus (FEEC). I view numerical analysis as a connection between continuous and discrete. Thus I am interested in its interactions with neighbouring areas, such as discrete geometry and topology, homological algebra, geometric mechanics; and applications in scientific problems, such as continuum mechanics, numerical relativity and geometric PDEs.  

I obtained my PhD at <a href='https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn'>Peking University</a> in 2017. I had postdoctoral positions at the <a href='https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/'>University of Oslo</a> (2017-2018) and <a href='https://cse.umn.edu/math'>   University of Minnesota</a> (2018-2020) before moving to <a href='https://www.ox.ac.uk'>   University of Oxford</a>  (affiliated with <a href='https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk'>Mathematical Institute</a> & <a href='https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk'>Christ Church</a>)  as a Hooke Research Fellow in 2021, and later as a Royal Society University Research Fellow. 


 With <a href='http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~jb2055/index.htm'>Julian Braun</a> (Heriot-Watt), I am co-organizing the <a href='https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics/events/acm'>Applied and Computational Mathematics (ACM) Seminars</a> joint between UoE and HW at the <a href='https://www.maxwell.ac.uk'>Maxwell Institute</a>.
